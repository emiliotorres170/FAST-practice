%The "Gas Data" tab will only contain data is the proper value is used in the input variable \emph{\textbf{nplot}}. This tab is very similar to the "2D Data" tab, with the plotting button labeled as "Gas Plot". However, the radial gas nodes are for the fuel mesh only and use a reversed nodalization from the temperature calculation (where 1 corresponds to the fuel centerline).

%APT Plot
%
%The ACS plug-in has been updated for use with APT Plot that allows it to read the plot file generated by FAST. This section is a brief overview of how to load the FRAPCON file into APT Plot. For more detailed information regarding the capabilities of APT Plot, visit \url{https://www.aptplot.com}. Additionally, APT Plot contains a "{H}elp" feature that contains additional information regarding the ACS plug-in and creating FAST plots.
%
%The same options that were outlined in Figure 5‑5 are available for plotting. After opening up the APT Plot program, search for the FAST generated plot file by selecting {F}ile -\textgreater{} {R}ead -\textgreater{} FRAPCON data. A pop-up window will appear that will allow for the selection of the \emph{FileName}.plot file. After selecting it, press Open. These steps are shown in Figure 5‑16.

% \caption{How to load FAST plot file in APT Plot}
%\end{figure}
%
%After pressing Open, a new window will appear (Figure \ref{fig:APT-Plot-Data-Channel-Example}) that contains all of the selectable variables (these are referred to as data channels within APT Plot). In this window, there are several options similar to those available in the FRAPlot tool. The user can select the plotting units (SI/British) and X-axis Time units. Rather than the multiple Tabs in the FRAPlot tool, a drop-down menu is available that allows for multiple Plot Types: Time Dependent, Axial and Radial plots. For the Axial and Radial plots, the plot time can be input; otherwise, it will default to the last time step.
