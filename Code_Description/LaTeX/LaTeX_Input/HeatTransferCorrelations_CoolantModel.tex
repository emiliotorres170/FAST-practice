\chapter{Coolant Model and Heat Transfer Correlations} \label{chapter:HTC_and_models}
The coolant enthalpy rise model and clad-to-coolant heat transfer correlations are described in this
chapter. The heat transfer correlations supply one of the equations required for calculation of the
fuel rod surface temperature, as discussed in Section~\ref{section:coolant-conditions}. Also
described is the calculation of the coolant void fraction for water. The available coolants are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Water (default)
  \item Sodium
  \item Helium
\end{itemize}

The following inputs are used to calculate the coolant temperature, pressure and heat transfer
coefficient as a function of time and location:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inlet temperature
  \item Inlet mass flux
  \item Inlet pressure
\end{itemize}

It is allowed to bypass the coolant model entirely but still use the built-in clad-to-coolant heat
transfer coefficients based on the coolant type. Instructions on how to use this option are provided
in Section~\ref{section:boundary_block}.
